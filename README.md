##Army Calculator, _you and these armies!_ :wink:

Simple troops amounts and costs calculator for [Clash of Clans](http://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/).
[Check it out!](http://gillchristian.github.io/clash)

###Future updates will include:

- Army saving, updating and exporting to quick check the costs of your most used armies for farm and war!
- Time needed to finish selected buildings.
- Dashboard with Town data:
	- Current buildings.
	- Available troops & spells.
	- Amount of resources needed to upgrade to next level.

Also if Supercell decides to make a public API I will work on some awesome features that I have in mind but are ~~almost~~ impossible with out an user info and data API as well as a game information API (troops values, building upgrades costs, etc.).

###Contribute!

You can check out the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/HlEgELzK) of the app, maybe even add some comments there for any kind of suggestions, bugs or anything.

Please if you see any bug, bad practice or problem you are welcome to submit an issue, or a pull request, and also features recommendations are *very* welecome, _if they are already pull request is even better! :wink:_
